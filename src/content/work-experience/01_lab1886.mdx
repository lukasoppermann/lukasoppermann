As a design lead at Lab1886 â€” the incubator of Daimler AG I split my time between hands-on project work from ideation to shipping a final product and the more organisational aspects. This includes mentoring and hiring designers, defining and implementing the processes and tools we use and shaping the design culture.

I believe in designing in the open, involving all stakeholders early in the process and making them partners and advocates of my vision. Within the design team I find it most important to trust & empower designers to make their own decision with the support and safety net they need.

**Impact:** We have a great team of designers working on different projects. I introduced a show & tell format to ensure we have a good design culture where we critique each others work and help each other grow.
