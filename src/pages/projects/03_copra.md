###### Challenge
Both the brand and the patient management software that Copra Software GmbH develops were in dire need of design attention. I was asked to refresh the corporate identity & website to better communicate their values without alienating existing customers.
###### Solution
After working closely together with the stakeholders from Copra to define the brand values & personality, I developed a new brand experience transforming the brand to be a state-of-the-art, honest & professional health software company. With this done I developed a design system to bring the new brand into the software as well.
###### Results
I successfully relaunch the brand with both, existing customers and potential clients, unanimously describing the new design as modern, friendly, reliable & professional. The implementation of the design systems improve the usability and user experience of the software and resulted in faster development cycles and a more coherent visual language.
