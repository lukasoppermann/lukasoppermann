###### Role

As a design lead at Lab1886 — the incubator of Daimler AG I split my time between hands-on project work from ideation to shipping a final product and the more organisational aspects. This includes mentoring and hiring designers, defining and implementing the processes and tools we use and shaping the design culture.

###### How I work

I believe in designing in the open, involving all stakeholders early in the process and making them partners and advocates of my vision. Within the design team I find it most important to trust & empower designers to make their own decision with the support and safety net they need. As a lead, it is essential to live the change you want to see in your team, to always stay curious and eager to learn and grow.

###### Impact

We have a great team of designers working on different projects. I introduced a show & tell format to ensure we have a good design culture where we critique each others work and help each other grow. I also started a presentation format to strengthen the role of design in the company and worked together with the other disciplines to improve our processes and tooling.
