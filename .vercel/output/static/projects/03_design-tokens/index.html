<h6 id="problem">Problem</h6>
<p>If you are building a modern design system in Figma you probably use design tokens. External design token solutions add complexity as they don’t sync well with Figma. Using an external tool &#x26; Figma to specify tokens means you have two sources of truth — not the idea behind design tokens.</p>
<h6 id="solution">Solution</h6>
<p>To solve this problem I developed the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/Design-Tokens">Figma Design Tokens plugin</a>. It allows you to export styles and specific token elements as a json file. You can transform the file for any platform (mobile, web, etc.) using amazon style dictionary. To further improve your workflow the plugin can directly publish the tokens to a github. It comes with a <a href="https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-token-transformer">template</a> that automatically transforms tokens using github action. Your development team can use the token repository as a dependency. This creates a perfect sync between design and development — making sure the dev team always has the latest tokens. You can read more about this approach in my article on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/building-better-products-with-the-design-token-pipeline-faa86aa068e8">building a better design token pipeline</a>.</p>
