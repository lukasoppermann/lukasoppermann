<h6 id="challenge">Challenge</h6>
<p>Both the brand and the patient management software that Copra Software GmbH develops were in dire need of design attention. I was asked to refresh the corporate identity &#x26; website to better communicate their values without alienating existing customers.</p>
<h6 id="solution">Solution</h6>
<p>After working closely together with the stakeholders from Copra to define the brand values &#x26; personality, I developed a new brand experience transforming the brand to be a state-of-the-art, honest &#x26; professional health software company. With this done I developed a design system to bring the new brand into the software as well.</p>
<h6 id="results">Results</h6>
<p>I successfully relaunch the brand with both, existing customers and potential clients, unanimously describing the new design as modern, friendly, reliable &#x26; professional. The implementation of the design systems improve the usability and user experience of the software and resulted in faster development cycles and a more coherent visual language.</p>
