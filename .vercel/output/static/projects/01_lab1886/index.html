<h6 id="role">Role</h6>
<p>As a design lead at Lab1886 â€” the incubator of Daimler AG I split my time between hands-on project work from ideation to shipping a final product and the more organisational aspects. This includes mentoring and hiring designers, defining and implementing the processes and tools we use and shaping the design culture.</p>
<h6 id="how-i-work">How I work</h6>
<p>I believe in designing in the open, involving all stakeholders early in the process and making them partners and advocates of my vision. Within the design team I find it most important to trust &#x26; empower designers to make their own decision with the support and safety net they need. As a lead, it is essential to live the change you want to see in your team, to always stay curious and eager to learn and grow.</p>
<h6 id="impact">Impact</h6>
<p>We have a great team of designers working on different projects. I introduced a show &#x26; tell format to ensure we have a good design culture where we critique each others work and help each other grow. I also started a presentation format to strengthen the role of design in the company and worked together with the other disciplines to improve our processes and tooling.</p>
