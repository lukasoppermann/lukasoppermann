<h6 id="challenge">Challenge</h6>
<p>The digital products for the Bosch eBike had huge inconsistencies in their user experience. My research showed that especially new and occasional users had difficulties using them. My goal was to improve usability &#x26; consistency without negatively impacting power users.</p>
<h6 id="solution">Solution</h6>
<p>In order to start shipping improvements quickly &#x26; iteratively I built a design system. This allowed to improve the user experience one element at a time. It also allowed to develop new features faster and with fewer bugs. Before implementing new features &#x26; changes I built prototypes to test with users. I then applied the learnings to my designs, before handing them to the developers.</p>
<h6 id="results">Results</h6>
<p>I successfully built a design system and developed new features with it. Additionally I refreshed all products with the design system, making them visually consistent and easy to use. This resulted in a 30% increase of weekly recurring web logins and a 2 star rating increase in the app stores.</p>
